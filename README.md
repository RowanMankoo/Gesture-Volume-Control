# Gesture-Volume-Control

This project concerns itself with volume control via gesture recognition. The idea behind the project is to set volume according to the distance between the thumb and index fingertips. to assist with this project two open-source libraries ```MediaPipe``` and ```Pycaw``` have been used for hand pose estimation and volume interaction respectively.
